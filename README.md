# 🛠️ workcli

`workcli` is a flexible, developer-focused CLI tool written in Rust designed to help you **track work tasks**, **log time spent on projects**, and **generate daily events** in your macOS calendar — all from your terminal.

## 🚀 Features (Planned & In Progress)

### ✅ Task & Note Management
- Add, list, search, and mark **to-do tasks**
- Attach **notes** to tasks or create standalone notes
- Support for syntax-like **highlighting** in CLI:
  - `@variables`, `#functions()`, `#tags`, dates, etc.

### ⏱️ Time Tracking System (Planned)
- Start a **timer** with a specific project
- Dynamically list or create projects in the CLI
- Automatically create a **macOS Calendar** event for the day

### 🎨 Syntax-Style Terminal Coloring
Inspired by code editors:
- Real-time highlighting as you type
- Custom theme/colors for commands, variables, and tags
